<h3>
    A gifted mathematician, Ada Lovelace is considered to have written instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s.
</h3>

<p>
    In her own words:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine... supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.
    </p>

<h3>
    What makes Ada Lovelace a notable scientist?
</h3>

<p>
    Well off enough to be well educated in early 1800's England, this daughter of poet Baron George Gordon Byron, wielded mathematical talents even as a teenager. At the age of 18 she commenced a long professional relationship with British mathematician George Babbage, deemed by some to be the father of computers. Her extensive notes to her translation from the French of a book on Babbage's concept of an <q>Analytical Engine</q> included the first ever published algorithm, a method for calculating a sequence of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number' target=_blank>Bernoulli numbers</a>, to be carried out by such a machine once built. Though some argue there is no evidence that she created the algorithm, most do consider her to be the author (see Ada Initiative link below for a discussion). For this work she is considered the first computer programmer. Perhaps more importantly, Lovelace had the vision to see how this Analytical Engine could process data beyond computing numbers, something Babbage and others never conceived.

            She was raised by her maternal grandmother, who doted on her. Her father had sent her mother and she away when she was one month old.

        <li>
            At the age of 12 Lovelace began to design flying <q>wings</q> by studying the wings of birds. She envisioned her flight to be powered by steam.

        <li>
            She created, and lost thousands of pounds (I will not pun) testing a mathematical model to win large bets.
        </li>

        <li>
            Her intelligence and vision presaged the era of modern computing. She was a visionary, while others, including Brabbage, did not fully see the implications of his Analytical Engine concept.
